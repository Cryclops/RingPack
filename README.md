RingPack
	A 'Notification ringtone' rotator for Android. Currently published in the
	Android Market by Cryclops.
	
	It is being open source-ed because users with certain phones are
	experiencing issues that are beyond my expertise to solve. I hope that the
	community can come together to find the bugs, which I will post in the
	issues section.
